Analysis of expenditures by 527 Nonprofit Political Organizations based in New Jersey.

From ProPublica's 527 Explorer:

A 527 is a nonprofit formed under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, which grants tax-exempt status to organizations whose primary purpose is attempting to influence the election of one or more people to public office at the national, state or local level. But contributions to these organizations are not considered tax-deductible, unlike gifts to charities.
